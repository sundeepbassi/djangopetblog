### Known Issues
On the 31st of January I had to contact tutor support again and explain that I could not locate the env.py file that I had created twice on my filing system.  I sent tutor support screen shots of my filess.

Tutor Support informed me that it was best to open up my workspace by gitpod.io/workspaces into your url bar. 

During the deployment process on the 1st of February 2022 there was an error message when opening the app.  Tutor support informed it was best to git commit and push prior to deployment and this resolved the issue and the site was successfully deployed.

On the 1st of February 2022 there were issues with performing the python3 manage.py makemigrations for the data models that were created for the post and comments. The tutors informed me that the issue was to do with Heroku updating its config vars and that I would need to recopy the DATABASE_URL code and put it in the env file.  This resolved the issues and the makemigrations and the migrate commands worked.

On the 2nd of February I noticed that my env.py had disappeared again and I had been working on it the night before to update the config vars links as suggested by the tutors because they informed me that Heroku sometimes update their servers and the links can change.  I contacted the tutors again and informed them that the env.py had disappeared again and I had followed the correct procedures to open the work as suggested by the tutors previously.  I also informed them that I could not log into Heroku.  The tutors told me that the Heroku site was not accessible as engineers were working on it. The tutors helped me to set up a environment variable and told me to use the https://gitpod.io/workspaces to ooen and stop projects.

On the 14th of February I had to contact tutor support as I could not make a git commit and I also tried to do it through source control.  I had to do some git commits from the week before.  I had to resubmit my project 3 which took a week to do.  Tutor support said that I would need to do a git pull but the issue was a conflict in the requirements file.  Once this was resolved the tutor support gave me commands to restore my workspace to be able to do git commits.


### Deployment 
The project was deployed early on the 1st of February 2022 as recommended by the Code Institute walkthrough I think therefore I blog. 

Steps to Deployment

- Create the Heroku app.

- Attach the postgreSQL database

- Prepare the environment and settings.py files.

- Get our static and media files stored on cloudinary. 

### Credits

On the 28th of January tried to do a number of git commits for what I had done for the project.  I noticed the 29th of January that these commits did not show on my github and I did do a git push also.  Student tutors advised me to ensure that all git commits are done once code has been installed and saved in the files.
The following steps were put into the git commits on the 28th of January. The steps for these installations were shown in the Code Institute Walkthrough project I think therefore I blog.

Welcome sundeepbassi,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

---

Happy coding!
