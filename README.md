# Introduction

## About Petblog

This blog was created for a user who has an interest in animal welfare and for people who love their pets.

The user has always had a passion for taking care of animals and rescuing animals that have been injured.  The user usually uses social media to keep in touch with people that share an interest in animal welfare.

### Initial Discussion
One of the reasons the user wanted a blog was to create a forum to keep in touch with fellow animal lovers and to also raise awareness about animal welfare. As the user stated "a social media platform for animal lovers and the joy we share in looking after them, our furry companions"

### The Development Planes

- To develop a blog that would appeal to animal and pet lovers.

- Initially the user (a friend who loves animals) had shown an interest in wanting to have a blog to share this interest with other pet lovers.

- The user and I looked at other blogs listed in the credits section to see how best to design and layout the information for the blog.  This research assisted in the development process.

## Strategy

The target audience is users, the admin and everyone who has a love for animals and pets.  The target audience is aimed at a specific audience interested in animal welfare or anyone interested in getting a pet to learn more.


#### Roles

- User

- Potential User

- Managing Site Admin

#### Interested Users

- Users who have pets and are passionate about animal welfare.

- There is no age range as both adults and children can care for pets.

#### Potential Users

- Then there are those users that are interested in getting a pet and want to learn more about animal welfare.

- During the covid-19 pandemic we saw an interest in the number of people wanting to get a pet. Especially as people began to work from home or were furloughed.

- There are also users that for some reason are unable to keep a pet (such as the elderly or residential restrictions) and the blog would help them keep in touch by making comments about blog posts. This would help this target audience to remain engaged in animal welfare.

#### Managing Site Admin

This will be the person who can manage the administration of the site.


### Scope 

The scope of this project is to take into consideration the functions and features required for this blog. With defining the user stories it was essential to consider what functions would be important for this project.

The blog will allow the user to:

  - The user must be able to navigate around the blog easily on each page.

  - See and read posts about pets and animal welfare.

  - To have the opportunity to register and sign up as a user.

  - To be able to leave comments on posts.

  - To be able to update comments that they have left about posts.

  - To be able to delete comments that they have made about posts.

  - If the user gets to the delete stage and wants to cancel deleting the post they have that option   
    also with the cancel button.

  - The User can also logout.

The blog will allow the admin to:

- Create, read, update and delete posts in the admin section.

- Approve comments made by registered users.


### Structure

## Skeleton

### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq to create the wireframes.  This helped with the planning and layout of the blog.

The home page for the blog

[Homepage](wireframes/homepage2.png)

The registration sign up page for the blog.

[Signup page](wireframes/signup2.png)

The login page for the blog.

[Login page](wireframes/signin2.png)

Both the about page and the gallery page wireframes were created during the implementation of the blog as we realised that these pages would add interest and extra information about the blog.

The About page for the blog.

[About](wireframes/about.png)

The Gallery page for the blog.

[Gallery](wireframes/gallery.png)

This is a wireframe below for a registered user. The registered user can make a comment on a post and also edit and delete their specific comment.

[Registered user logged in](wireframes/loggedin.png)

The edit a comment page.

### Design

#### Logo

Both Shanti and I chose the logo for the blog because we wanted it to convey an emotional response of how the love for animals should stand out in this blog.  The logo of the cat and dog showed that this was a pet blog aimed at pet lovers and therefore conveyed a simple and effective message of happiness and joy.

#### Colour 
Shanti is also an artist and chose the colour scheme for the blog.  She wanted to contrast the colour for the heading against the simple white background to create interest for the users and to make the blog look more welcoming. The individual blog card posts were also given a hint of light blue background so that they would be recognised as blog postcards.

#### Typography
The font used for the blog is Poppins from google fonts.  We felt that this font looked very stylish and with further research realised this font added simplicity and easy readability for the user. 

[SmartBug My favourite fonts right now](https://www.smartbugmedia.com/blog/design-trends-fonts#:~:text=Poppins%20is%20geometric%20in%20style,to%20improve%20readability%20and%20style.)

### Features


#### Design Features

- The Navigation, Header and Footer are on every page in the blog to make it easy for the user to have consistency and ease of use when getting around the blog.

#### Navigation

- We decided to keep the main navigation to the left-hand side. We did some research into where the best place was to place the navigation and it was shown that the top left-hand side was the most preferred area for users to use navigation and menu. As this is a blog we wanted the user to have ease of control in navigating around the blog to view posts and add comments.

[Lion and Mason Navigation Menu](https://www.lionandmason.com/ux-blog/is-top-navigation-or-side-navigation-better-for-your-product/)

#### Header 

- The header contains the title Petsstar and it also contains the navigation for the site.  This incorporates the Logo, Home, About, Register, Login and Gallery.  On the far right-hand side is a short statement about pet lovers.

- We wanted to keep the header simple and easy to use for the user.  Thereby not overwhelming them with too much information.

#### Footer

- The footer incorporates the social media icons for the user to link to. There is also a statement about the blog being created by pet lovers to reinforce the value to the user that the site has been made by pet lovers for pet lovers and their pets.

#### Home

- The home page has the header and footer with the navigation.  This page is where the user first lands and where the main blog posts are kept.  The user has the option of viewing each blog post page by clicking on the title of that blog post.  There is a date and time message of when the blog post was created underneath the title of a particular blog post.  There is a heart symbol likes button but this can only be accessed when the user has registered and signed up as a user.  There is also an image above every blog post. The author/administrator's name is also placed within the image.

#### Blog Post Page

- In the blog post page we have the header and the footer.  On this page the user can view an image of an animal and a title for the blog post.  Underneath the title is the author of that blog post which is the admin and the date and time when the post was created.  The post has written information for a user to read and videos on further information have been added to the about dog breeds page to show that other media can also be used.

- There is a heart symbol for the user to press to click if they like a post.

- There is a comments symbol showing the total number of comments made on a post.

- There is a comments section at the bottom of the page that users can view to read registered users' comments.

- If the user is registered and logged into the blog they can make comments in the blog post page and they also have the option to edit and delete their specific comments that they have made about a particular blog.

#### Register

- The registration page is for new users that wish to join the site.  There is a header and footer. There is a signup title. There is information about this being a sign-up page and that for existing users they can use the login function.  I wanted to keep the registration process simple and easy to use.  The user has to fill in a username category, email which is left optional, a password and a resubmission of that password.

#### Login

- The login is for existing users to access the site.  There is a header and footer. There is a sign in the title. There is information about signing in and a redirect facility for those that have not signed up. The signed up user has to fill in the username and password settings to login in successfully.  Users that are registered can create comments on a particular post, read a comment about a post, update a post and delete a post.  The admin can approve the comments from signed up users.

#### Update A Comment

- On this page the user can update a comment that they have made on a particular post. The user was also given the option to have a cancel button if they decided to change their minds.

#### Delete A Comment

- On this page the user can delete a comment that they have made on a particular post. The user was also given the option to have a cancel button if they decided to change their minds.


#### Logout
- Signed up users can log out after signing into the blog. The user is taken to a page to check if they want to sign out and if they want to sign out, they click the sign out button and this will redirect the user back to the homepage.

 

### Future Features

- For future features, it would be good to give users the ability to send photos of their pets.

### Further Testing

### Manual Testing

#### Testing of Registration Form

In the test below just the name is entered Steve Jobs and a password apple.  

- The User is notified that a valid username needs to be entered and that the password is too short.

- [Test signup page](static/images/signuptest1.png)

We tested a username for a value that we thought should fail (+), however, the system allowed us to register with this symbol as the username. We investigated if this was a valid username according to the Django authentication specification and we found that the (+) is a valid character for usernames. Please see the screenshots below.

- [Signup with + character](static/images/signup3.png)

- [Django Authentication](static/images/djangotest.png)

We entered an incorrect email address and we were informed this was invalid. 

- [Invalid email](static/images/invalidemail.png)

#### Testing of Sign In Form

We entered nothing into either field and pressed the Sign In button and we were informed the username must not be empty.

- [Empty Sign In](static/images/emptylogin.png)


We entered nothing into the password field and pressed the Sign In button and we were informed the password must not be empty.

- [Empty Sign In](static/images/emptypass.png)

We performed a test with a non-existent username and we expected to get some kind of error message.  However, we got no error messages we thought the test failed.  We therefore investigated the login code and we found that the form error code was not working.  We fixed the form error code and when we reperformed the test we were now warned that the username and password were invalid. 

- [Empty Sign In](static/images/invalidsignin.png)

During the testing process, we decided to see if we could edit another user's comment. When editing a comment there is a specific URL for editing a comment and this URL will contain the id of the comment therefore if you use an id that is not yours you can incorrectly edit it.  Therefore we put in some security code to stop people from doing this. On repeating the test we correctly found that we are blocked from editing another user's comments and the appropriate error message is displayed.

#### Cybersecurity Testing

- [Edit](static/images/cybertest.png)

This same process was also applied to the delete comments and we were blocked from deleting another user's comment (because we had added a similar security code to block this).  An appropriate error message was displayed.

- [Delete](static/images/deletecomment.png)

Tested to see if a standard user (i.e. not admin) should not be able to access the admin panel. When we checked we were correctly informed that we were not logged in as an administrator and we were prompted to log in as a different user.

- [Admin only access](static/images/adtest.png)

#### Comment Testing

When we tried to add a comment we were notified that our comment was awaiting approval.

- [Add a Comment](static/images/commapproval.png)

I went to the admin section to see if the comment had been added (it had been added and correctly awaiting approval)

- [Add a Comment awaiting approval](static/images/awaiting.png)

- [Comments Section without comment](static/images/comms.png)


The comment has been approved in the admin section.

- [Approved Comment in Admin](static/images/approved.png)

Now that the comment has been approved by the admin it is being displayed in the comments section of that blog post.

- [Displayed Comment in comments section](static/images/commsubmit.png)

### Known Issues

Noticed Google Chrome browser was auto-filling fields in the registration form (sign up), which isn't appropriate, of course, it's ok if Chrome auto-fills the login form, however, we don't want it to autofill the registration form. We realised that Chrome must have mistakenly remembered the autofill on that form, somewhere in development, however, we tested it in Chrome using a new profile, and it no longer offered to remember, and also it didn't autofill the fields. We believe this won't happen to other people.

On the 31st of January, I had to contact tutor support again and explain that I could not locate the env.py file that I had created twice on my filing system.  I sent tutor support screenshots of my files.

Tutor Support informed me that it was best to open up my workspace by gitpod.io/workspaces into your URL bar. 

During the deployment process on the 1st of February 2022, there was an error message when opening the app.  Tutor support informed us it was best to git commit and push before deployment and this resolved the issue and the site was successfully deployed.

On the 1st of February 2022, there were issues with performing the python3 manage.py makemigrations for the data models that were created for the post and comments. The tutors informed me that the issue was to do with Heroku updating its config vars and that I would need to recopy the DATABASE_URL code and put it in the env file.  This resolved the issues and the makemigrations and the migrate commands worked.

On the 2nd of February, I noticed that my env.py had disappeared again and I had been working on it the night before to update the config vars links as suggested by the tutors because they informed me that Heroku sometimes updates their servers and the links can change.  I contacted the tutors again and informed them that the env.py had disappeared again and I had followed the correct procedures to open the work as suggested by the tutors previously.  I also informed them that I could not log into Heroku.  The tutors told me that the Heroku site was not accessible as engineers were working on it. The tutors helped me to set up an environment variable and told me to use the https://gitpod.io/workspaces to open and stop projects.

cloudinary://571451748687539:2KTq0GgqN_vNbGGDB_nWNoN8Lws@sunnyalways

On the 14th of February, I had to contact tutor support as I could not make a git commit and I also tried to do it through source control.  I had to do some git commits from the week before.  I had to resubmit my project 3 which took a week to do.  Tutor support said that I would need to do a git pull but the issue was a conflict in the requirements file.  Once this was resolved the tutor support gave me commands to restore my workspace to be able to do git commits.

On the 7th of April, I contacted tutor support as I was concerned about the 6 warnings that were showing the models.py, views.py and settings.py files.  

The tutor support team informed me that 

"I'm good thanks 🙂 the warnings from the views and models here can be ignored
(screenshot of the terminal window with the warnings for the models.py, views.py and settings.py files.)
It's an issue with pylint, try putting your code through an online python validator."

I followed the tutor support advice and put the code from models.py, views.py and settings.py files into the PEP8 Online check and all 3 files said All Right. 

After doing the Pep8 checks on all 3 files and they passed, the tutor support was happy for me to continue.

"ok perfect looks like you're good to go 🙂
1:28 pm
Brilliant Oisin you have been excellent that really reassures me is it ok to mention it in my readme that those warnings can be ignored? for the assessor
Oisin profile
yep you could mention it in your readme and validate all of your python files with the pep8 checker
Thank you Oisin for your wonderful advise and it really has helped me. Please let your manager know that you have brilliant tutoring skills"



### Deployment 
The project was deployed early on the 1st of February 2022 as recommended by the Code Institute walkthrough I think therefore I blog. 

Steps to Deployment

- Navigate to the Heroku website

- I already had an account with Heroku

- I Created Petstar app on the Heroku app and selected the location.

- I went to the resources tab and under add ons typed in Postgres and selected the Postgres Heroku option. Attach the PostgreSQL database

- Prepare the  settings.py files and the environment
- I had to click the settings tab and clicked on the Reveal Config Vars and from the DATABASE_URL I copied the URL next to it.
- Then I had to create an env.py file in the main directory in my Gitpod workspace.

- I added the code to set up the DATABASE_URL in the env.py file. Then I added the value from Heroku next to the Database_URL.

- I set up the SECRET_KEY in the env.py file and also added the value to it.

- Then I went Heroku and in the Config Vars I added the SECRET_KEY value.

- Then I had to update the settings.py file by importing the env.py file and adding the DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY file paths.

- Then I had to create an account with Cloudinary.

- From Cloudinary I copied the URL and pasted it into the Heroku Config Vars and this was also pasted into the setting.py file. 

- I then went to the settings.py file and added the following sections.

- In the INSTALLED_APPS list I added Cloudinary.
- STATICFILE_STORAGE
- STATICFILES_DIRS
- STATIC_ROOT
- MEDIA_URL
- DEFAULT_FILES_STORAGE
- TEMPLATES_DIR
- The DIRS were updated in TEMPLATES WITH TEMPLATES_DIR
- The ALLOWED_HOSTS were updated with ['app_name.heroku.com','localhost']

When I did do the early deployment as advised in the Code Institute walkthrough I think therefore I blog, the deployment worked well.  Then one day there were problems getting the site to work I had to contact tutor support and they said that because Heroku had been doing maintenance work on their site that Config Vars DATABSE_URL would have been changed and therefore it would be best to recopy this and add it to my env.py file again. I did this and the site worked well.

STILL NEED TO ADD MORE INFORMATION
- Get our static and media files stored on Cloudinary. 

The final deployment steps

### Credits

I am indebted to Mike Y for being a great tutor and in guiding me thoroughly with this project and showing me how a professional software engineer approaches and works with code.  I learnt a lot from Mike and when I was struggling he pushed me to not give up and to carry on and do my best.  Even my mentor commented on how my learning had excelled with getting excellent support from Mike.

On the 28th of January tried to do some git commits for what I had done for the project.  I noticed on the 29th of January that these commits did not show on my GitHub and I did do a git push also.  Student tutors advised me to ensure that all git commits are done once code has been installed and saved in the files.
The following steps were put into the git commits on the 28th of January. The steps for these installations were shown in the Code Institute Walkthrough project I think therefore I blog.

On the 2nd of April, I had my first meeting with my mentor and he advised me to ensure I get an update and delete function for my comments section of the blog.

I contacted tutor support and they sent me a youtube video from Codemy and a resource link to Django 

On the 3rd of April 2022, I contacted an IT and software development specialist and tutor Mike Y for support in tutoring me on how to incorporate the update and delete functionality into the comments section.  

On the 4th of April 2022, Mike guided me through the process with the aid of a youtube video by Codemy [Codemy update & edit a blog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7xaESAddDQ). 

With Mike's generous support we were able to set up the update_detail, HTML file and input the code for that file to display the update function. This was following the Codemy video code.  Mike also explained to me in better detail what the blog URL file was doing when we inputted the code from the Codemy file.  Mike also explained to me what a slug and an int/pk were and the difference in how they are displayed in the URL browser.  We then inputted the code into the views file for the class for updating the comments.  Mike also supported me to look at the code needed for the post_detail file within the comments section.

We also used [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/db/examples/many_to_many/)
and [Djangocentral](https://djangocentral.com/creating-comments-system-with-django/)
and [Very Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUUjJdw3EBM&list=PLOLrQ9Pn6caxNb9eFZJ6LfY29nZkKmmXT&index=8).

We also looked on stack overflow for solutions to coding issues.

On the 5th April 2022, Mike the tutor taught me how to incorporate the CRUD (create, read, update and delete) Process.  We encountered a problem with the comments update process because the edit page was not returning to the comments page and was going to the home page. 

On the 6th of April Mike tutored me to check the warnings in the python files and use a search engine to input the warnings and find the best solutions to remove the warnings from the terminal windows. 

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54102214/django-how-to-set-background-colour-in-html-based-on-context)

and [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/db/examples/many_to_many/) were two very useful resources in helping to eradicate these warnings.
Mike explained to me whilst tutoring me that it was very good practice to remove warnings and bugs as soon as possible as it stopped any build-up of warnings and bugs.  He also explained that if the code had been altered through this process then it was easier to see if there were any problems when the site is being displayed.

To deploy the site was shown in the walkthrough video I think therefore I blog. 

Irish Becky's readme helped me to see how to structure the written material for the readme for the deployment process.

I also followed the process for the agile kanban board from the walkthrough video I think therefore I blog.

The database model for posts was shown in the walkthrough video I think therefore I blog.

The database model for comments was shown in the walkthrough video I think therefore I blog.

To handle the authorisation of correct users for the update_comment and the delete_comment was shown by my tutor Mike Y.  We also followed the video from  [Codemy How to determine the correct user to edit posts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1Us5jVT07E).
